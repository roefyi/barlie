## Technical Infrastructure

### Backend Services
- [ ] Set up database (Firebase, Supabase, or custom)
- [ ] Design database schema
- [ ] Implement API endpoints
- [ ] Set up image storage and CDN
- [ ] Configure push notification service
- [ ] Implement backup and disaster recovery

### iOS-Specific
- [ ] Add Core Data/SwiftData integration
- [ ] Implement proper navigation architecture
- [ ] Add deep linking support
- [ ] Configure app groups for sharing

## Current Status
- [x] Basic UI/UX implementation
- [x] Sample data integration
- [x] Navigation structure
- [x] Basic beer detail view
- [x] Rating system UI
- [x] List management UI

## Priority Order
1. **High Priority**: API integration, user authentication, real data
2. **Medium Priority**: Enhanced features, social functionality
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced analytics, widgets, deep linking

## Notes
- Focus on MVP first - get core functionality working with real data
- Test early and often with real users
- Consider starting with a simple API like Punk API for rapid prototyping
- Plan for scalability from the beginning
- Keep user experience as the top priority
